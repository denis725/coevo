% A function that calculates the cross-correlation between
% environment and behavior, then determines the peak value and its
% argument. In a next step, the environment vector is filtered by
% a running average filter with variable step size and the pro-
% cedure of finding the peak correlation is repeated.
% The reason to do this is as follows: If a learning strategy is
% able to react to small changes, its peak correlation should drop
% for higher window sizes of the filter, since the filter removes
% small variations. If a strategy, however, is more capable of
% following large trends, its peak correlation should increase, as
% the filter reveals larger trends.
% 1st input: behavior vector
% 2nd input: environment vector
