% The efficient market hypothesis states that the price of an asset reflects
% its fundamental value. In the confines of our model, it should then be
% possible to guess whether A or B is the better option by looking at the
% choice of the strategies. Moreover, changes in the value of A and B should
% be reflected in the price immediately and not just after some time has
% passed.
% 
% We checked whether this is true. For that, we look at the number of 
% true guesses (true A>B, true B>A) derived from the choices of the learning 
% strategies. Moreover, we filter away short term trends to check whether 
% accuracy increases if only longer trends are considered.
